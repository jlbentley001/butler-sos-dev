# Installing Butler SOS on Windows

User @Rumeister has contributed a walk-through of what a Windows install can look like.

It covers Butler SOS version 5.0.1, which was the latest version when the tutorial was written - it's fallen between the cracks here, getting it merged into the repo... ðŸ˜Ÿ  
Still, it's a useful tutorial for anyone looking at running Butler SOS on Windows.
